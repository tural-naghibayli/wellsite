          <h5>The C-O-I-N Method</h5>
          <br>
          <ol>

            <li>
              <strong>Connect:</strong> Find common ground with the feedback receiver.
              <ul>
                <li>“Can we agree that we both care about safety?”</li>
                <li>“Safety matters to me, does it matter to you too?”</li>
                <li>“My family expects me to work safely so I come home in one piece. Do you have a family?”</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
              <strong>Observations:</strong> Make specific, accurate descriptions of the observed behavior.
              <ul>
              <li>“I see you aren’t wearing your safety glasses.”</li>
              <li>“You were working on a machine without locking it out.”</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
              <strong>Impact:</strong> Describe the consequences of the behavior.
              <ul>
                <li>“You could get something in your eye and need to go to the emergency room.”</li>
                <li>“The machine could have started and you would have been badly injured.”</li>
              </ul>

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Next steps:</strong> Partner with the person to develop an action plan or behavior change to improve workplace safety.
              <ul>
                <li>"Let’s make sure your safety glasses fit properly and meet your needs. Come to my office and we can look at different models”</li>
                <li>“You are saying you have forgotten the work procedures. Let’s pause on this activity and I’m going to enroll you in a isolation refresher class.”</li>
                <li>“You couldn’t find the patient lift? Let’s make sure we’re keeping it where you can access it if needed."</li>
              </ul>

            <!-- Ask tell Ask Method -->
            <h5>The “Ask, Tell, Ask” Method</h5>
            <br>
            <ol>

              <li>
                <strong>First,</strong> ask the worker to assess their own performance. This begins a conversation, promotes reflection, and person’s self-awareness, level of insight.
                <br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>“How did the safety training go? Do you understand the procedure now?”</li>
                <li>“How did the new safety procedure work? Were you able to follow it?”</li>
                <li>“That was a heated safety committee meeting today. How do you feel you handled the conversation?”</li>
              </ul><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Then,</strong> tell what you observed. Give them some feedback on their self assessment, and include both positive and corrective elements.
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>“You were really engaged during the PPE module. It also looked like you had a harder time learning the fire protection material.”</li>
                  <li>“You were paying good attention. I saw many of the same things. I observed the team following the first two parts of the procedure. It also looked to me like they didn’t follow the last part properly.”</li>
                  <li>“I think the meeting went fairly well. The discussion about high visibility gear went well. Unfortunately, the discussion about forklift training wasn’t as productive.”</li>
                </ul><br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>End</strong> by asking about the worker’s understanding and improvement. Discuss what could be done differently. Give your own suggestions.
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>“How can you make sure you understand our fire prevention program?”</li>
                  <li>“Do you have any ideas for adjusting the last part of the new procedure?”</li>
                  <li>“How could we handle the forklift discussion better when it comes up at next month’s meeting?"</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

        <p>Good communication is important both in formal negotiations and in daily life.
        Difficult conversations are anything that someone does not want to talk about, such as raising a behavioral issue or complaining about service you recieve. So some conversation openers would be helpful.</p>

        <ul>
          <h6><em>Conversation openers:</em></h6>
          <li>I have something I’d like to discuss with you that I think will help us work together more effectively.</li>
          <li>I’d like to talk about ____________ with you, but first I’d like to get your point of view.</li>
          <li>I think we have different perceptions about _____________________. I’d like to hear your thinking on this.</li>
          <li>I’d like to talk about ___________________. I think we may have different ideas about how to _____________________.</li>
          <li>I’d like to see if we might reach a better understanding about ___________. I really want to hear your feelings about this and share my perspective as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <h6>Steps to follow:</h6>
          <li>Be direct and specific.</li>
          <li>No emotions.</li>
          <li>Ask and listen and validate.</li>
          <li>Hold person accountable by asking what action he/she will take?</li>
          <li>Offer your help.</li>
          <li>Follow up.</li>

        </ol>
